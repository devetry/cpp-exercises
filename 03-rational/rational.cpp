#include "rational.hpp"

// It's not allowed to declare `class Rational` again,
// since it's already in rational.hpp. Instead, to define
// functions as if they're inside that `class` block,
// use the :: scoping operator. For example, you can
// define `reduceToLowestTerms` like this:
void Rational::reduceToLowestTerms() {
