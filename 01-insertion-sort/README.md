## Insertion sort

Modify the code so that you have a correct insertion sort. The pseudo-code should be correct, so this is mostly an exercise in translating to C++ and getting familiar with the syntax.

### Check your work

Compile your code by running `g++ insertion-sort`. If all goes well, this will produce no errors or warnings, and a file called `a.out` will be created in the same directory. Run this executable with `./a.out` to run the code you've written.

If your code produces a sorted array, you should see "good job!" printed to the screen.
